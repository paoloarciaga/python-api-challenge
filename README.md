# API Challenge

This repo consists of two deliverables, WeatherPy and VacationPy. 

## WeatherPy
I used the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data from the cities list generated in the code. Iâ€™ve created a series of scatter plots to showcase the following relationships:
- Latitude vs. Temperature
- Latitude vs. Humidity
- Latitude vs. Cloudiness
- Latitude vs. Wind Speed

Then I computed the linear regression for each of those relationships. I separated the plots into Northern and Southern Hemispheres.
- Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
- Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
- Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
- Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude

## VacationPy
I used the Geoapify API and the geoViews Python library to create two map visualizations, which can be found as the attached screenshots in this repo.
